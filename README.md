Chack here:[https://avishaietach.github.io/Covid-19-Tracker/](https://avishaietach.github.io/Covid-19-Tracker/)

## Description

The app gives a real-time indication of the corona status in the countries of the world.
This project was built using React

## Features 

1. A table that gives an indication of the status of the new cases discovered that day.
The table can be filtered according to the number of cases from large to small or inverted, in alphabetical order.
2. A complete list of countries to choose from and an indication of how many new cases, recovering and   dead were added on the same day to the selected country (by default on the whole world) - you can return to a world view by selecting worldwide or by resetting the browser.
3. A map that gives a full indication of the cases that were (old and new) in each country using red circles, their radius is determined by the number of cases.
On the map you can click on the red circles and get information about each country accordingly
4. When selecting a country from the list of countries, the map will automatically switch to the selected country - you can return to a world view by selecting worldwide or by resetting the browser.
5. There are graphs showing the number of cases and the number of deaths according to the worldview.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
